<h3>PREVIOUS GENERATIONS OF MOBILE NETWORKS</h3>
<img src="History.jpg" alt="G'S" width="250" height="200">
<p align="justify">1G(First Generation) is for delivered analog voice in 1980 andthe phones generally had poor battery life and voice quality was large without much security, and would most often experience dropped calls. The maximum speed of 1G was 2.4 Kbps.Even after being the first wireless telecommunication technology, 1G technology wasn’t fully digital. Data transmissions were done in analog form at 150 Mhz and above frequency of radio waves. This was the biggest drawback of 1G technology. This led to insecurity of phone calls. Also due to less frequency bandwidth for 1G, data transmission speed was too low and was only feasible for phone calls as they take low data to carry the intended signals.</p>
<p align="justify">2G(Second Generation) is for delivered Digital voice(CDMA)in 1990 and It utilised digital signals for voice transmission. In this release a lot of improvements were done on 1G technology and it got an entirely different platform and hence was referred to as next generation. Fundamental concentrate of this technology was on digital signals and gave services to convey content and provide picture messages at low speed (in kbps). It utilised the bandwidth of 30 to 200 KHz. With the introduction of 2G in the early 1990s, we moved away from analog and jumped into the digital world. This gave us smaller devices, a more secure connection, better call quality, and a higher capacity for connectivity..</p>
<p align="justify">3G(Third Generation) is wireless mobile telecommunications technology in 2000 and3G technology enhanced data transmission and offered better data rate at least of 384kbps for moving stance and 2Mbps for stationary stance. This provided better network services and also attracted customers to use internet. Along with voice telephony, users could do video call, conferencing call on the move, mobile TV, etc. This helped several businesses to grow remotely and also improved far connectivity in lesser time. Also, better encrypting/encoding technique used to transmit data added a better data security. 3G devices became smaller in size and also battery life improved with better frequency and encoding technique. Smartphones then boomed in the mobile phone market. Customers started to buy phones having more and better quality features .</p>
<p align="justify">4G(Fourth Generation)-In 2008, 4G technology started to roll out but had issues to commercially announce the then communication system as 4G due to minimum standard requirements which were not fulfilled. But with advancement in wireless telecommunication technology, minimum requirements for 4G technology were accomplished due to which authorities agreed to call the existing new technology 4G technology. It fulfilled the gap that was missing for more secured data transmission. All IP packet switch network domains are used for 4G compliance which means all transmission is based on Internet Protocol.Here, data is given the highest priority.</p>

<h3>UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY BEHIND 5G</h3>
<img src="OFDM.jpg" alt="G'S" width="300" height="250">
<p align="justify">5G is based on OFDM (Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing), a method of modulating a digital signal across several different channels to reduce interference. 5G uses 5G NR air interface alongside OFDM principles
5G uses 5G NR air interface alongside of DM principles of DM principles.5G also uses wider broadwith technologies such as sub 6GHZ and mm wave.</p>

<h3>HOW 5G AFFECT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY</h3>

</video>
<p align="justify">1.Qualcomm predicts the 5G value chain will generate up to $3.5 trillion in revenue in 2035, and support as many as 22 million jobs.</p>
<p align="justify">2.5G is set to power billions of connections and be the network infrastructure for the Internet of everything. It promises to reinvent the business world, solve problems we haven’t yet encountered and have a major impact on every aspect of our digital lives.</p>
<p align="justify">3.supports wide range of industries and potentially enabling upto $13.2 trillion worth of goods and services.</p>
<br>
<h3>WHERE IS 5G BEING USED?</h3>
<p align="justify">1.Enhanced Mobile broad band-Where Virtual reality and augmented reality with faster and more uniform data rates,lower latency and lower cost</p>
<p align="justify">2.Mission critical communication-5G can transform industries with ultra reliable ,low latency links like remote control of critical infrastructure,Vehicles and medical procedures. </p>
<p align="justify">3.IOT-It is meant to seamlessly connect a massive number of embedded sensors in virtually everything through the ability to scale down in the data rates,power and mobility.</p>
<br>
<h3>IS 5G AVAILABLE NOW? </h3>
<p align="justify">5G is already here today, and global operators started launching new 5G networks in early 2019. In 2020, many countries expect nationwide 5G mobile networks. Also, all major Android phone manufacturers are commercializing 5G phones. And soon, even more people may be able to access 5G.</p>
<p align="justify">Jio 5G will premiere for consumers in 2021, and will be sourced to other nations as well, noted Ambani while adding that the company would use 100 per cent local technologies and solutions.The firm also has plans to export its 5G solutions globally once it deploys the 5G framework successfully in the country.</p>
